## Setup

### Installing the dependencies

1. Install Go. Visit [Download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install) for more information.
2. Running `go run main.go` will automatically download the dependencies and execute the program.

### Pre-commit

This repository leverages [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run custom git hooks.

1. Install the git hooks

   ```
   $ pre-commit install
   ```

Each time that you make a commit, it will run all the git hooks specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Pull requests

Each pull request requires a changelog entry. This can be generated by running:

```sh
$ make changelog
```

### Commits

Please use the proper commit message format as elaborated by the [AngularJS team](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).

All pull requests without proper commit message will be rejected.
